	public static final String POSITIVE = "This DVD has everything if you love Jaws! The extra footage is massive! All of the inner workings - or malfunctions - of the shark are presented here. The movie itself is classic. I remember being so scared of the water after seeing this movie. The acting/directing here is superb, and the shark itself is terrifying. Now, I know there are those that will say that the shark looks too fake or that it doesn't show up enough. However, have you ever seen \"Deep Blue Sea?\" Jaws is everything that \"sea\" isn't. The absence of the shark actually builds the suspense in the movie. This movie is incredible and the extra features make this an incredible DVD purchase! \"Jaws\" is a tremendously entertaining action/adventure film. It's not really a horror film although it contains horror elements. Director Spielberg draws superlative performances from his main characters and it's their interplay which is particularly memorable. Brilliantly directed and conceived by Spielberg and featuring the iconic John Willams theme - this is a film classic. Don't bother with any of the sequels. The movie has everything one in this genre should have, suspense, action, mystery, thrills, betrayal, love and even humor! I will probably watch this movie again soon because I know I will enjoy it a second time. If you have not seen it yet, I recommend you do it as soon as possible. Simply put, this film can't earn less than 5 stars; it's a seamless piece of work that should really have run off with more awards than it got. The performances are universally excellent--and maybe the casting director has to take the credit, maybe not--so it's hard to pick a singular stand-out lead in the whole piece. And Kevin Spacey is generally so good, we kind of take it for granted here. Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce as virtual unknowns in a Hollywood picture convince you very early on that they belong in the film. Shot on location in Hollywood, with all the appropriate setpieces, hairstyles, mannerisms, this is a film that (minus the profanity and nudity) could have been released 40 years ago to similar acclaim. It won a well-deserved Academy award for its screenplay, but from top to bottom, this film is a perennial and should find its way into every DVD player until the end of time. This movie is one of the best movies ever made, and definitely one of my favorites. This movies takes you down to the boundaries of \"Hell\". Clive Barker has most certainly made history with \"Hellraiser\", and I don't think there will ever be one like it again. I love when Pinhead goes \"Oh Kirsty, I have such sights to show you\". Barker took gore to another level because I was definitely creeped out by Frank walking around with no skin on his very bloody, and very fleshy skeleton. There definitely aren't too many scary and orginal horror movies today but, \"Hellraiser\" is one of a kind.";
	public static final String NEGATIVE = "I expected this to be the funniest film ever made. Well, it's not. However, it is original and Sacha Baron Cohen put forth a tour de force performance in \"Borat\". In my opinion the funniest parts of the film are those in which Cohen as Borat, interacts with people who have no idea who he is. His attempts to give men welcome kisses as he walks the streets of NY are hysterical. The driving lesson is outrageously funny as a real driving instructor, oblivious to the fact that Cohen is acting, tries to cope with Borat's attempts to drink booze while shouting obscenities at other drivers. You will fall down laughing. Another great segment is the ride in the RV with the sexist college frat boys. Cutting edge stuff. However, a lot of the other material falls flat. The rodeo is embarrassing. The nude wrestling scene could have used a good edit. Pamela Anderson obviously knew who Cohen was when he appeared at her \"book signing\" and it's just not spontaneous. Also -- what happened to the song, \"Throw the J**s down the well so my country can be free?\" I heard it prior to the film's release; it really made you think about the convenience anti-semitism provides to some folks and, at the same time, was terribly funny. Much better than the National Anthem sequence at the rodeo. Gone in the R-rated version. Also, warning - the scatological humor in \"Borat\" is just revolting. See the film -- Cohen is amazing. But I'm wondering where he can go from here. I hope his next film has a better editor and is a bit better crafted. \"Hostage\" for all of its action is really a pretty boring picture. Once the movie started to focus more on the action and less on the characters I found myself tunning out every now and then. The movie started off as a character study of Talley and then just abandons everything for action. Why? They were starting off so well. But what are we going to do. Here is a perfect example of why Hollywood has been losing money lately as attendance is a recent lows. People simply aren't going out to see movies anymore because we don't wnat to see movies like \"Hostage\". Why should I pay 10 dollars to goes see junk like this when I can rent it for half the price or even wait for it to play on TV? This is why of weeks Hollywood is losing out. They don't realize we are sick of their movies. But go ahead Hollywood keep making these movies and losing money. It merely shows how out of touch you are with the public. ";

	public static final String POSITIVE = "This DVD has everything if you love Jaws! The extra footage is massive! All of the inner workings - or malfunctions - of the shark are presented here. The movie itself is classic. I remember being so scared of the water after seeing this movie. The acting/directing here is superb, and the shark itself is terrifying. Now, I know there are those that will say that the shark looks too fake or that it doesn't show up enough. However, have you ever seen \"Deep Blue Sea?\" Jaws is everything that \"sea\" isn't. The absence of the shark actually builds the suspense in the movie. This movie is incredible and the extra features make this an incredible DVD purchase! \"Jaws\" is a tremendously entertaining action/adventure film. It's not really a horror film although it contains horror elements. Director Spielberg draws superlative performances from his main characters and it's their interplay which is particularly memorable. Brilliantly directed and conceived by Spielberg and featuring the iconic John Willams theme - this is a film classic. Don't bother with any of the sequels. The movie has everything one in this genre should have, suspense, action, mystery, thrills, betrayal, love and even humor! I will probably watch this movie again soon because I know I will enjoy it a second time. If you have not seen it yet, I recommend you do it as soon as possible. Simply put, this film can't earn less than 5 stars; it's a seamless piece of work that should really have run off with more awards than it got. The performances are universally excellent--and maybe the casting director has to take the credit, maybe not--so it's hard to pick a singular stand-out lead in the whole piece. And Kevin Spacey is generally so good, we kind of take it for granted here. Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce as virtual unknowns in a Hollywood picture convince you very early on that they belong in the film. Shot on location in Hollywood, with all the appropriate setpieces, hairstyles, mannerisms, this is a film that (minus the profanity and nudity) could have been released 40 years ago to similar acclaim. It won a well-deserved Academy award for its screenplay, but from top to bottom, this film is a perennial and should find its way into every DVD player until the end of time. This movie is one of the best movies ever made, and definitely one of my favorites. This movies takes you down to the boundaries of \"Hell\". Clive Barker has most certainly made history with \"Hellraiser\", and I don't think there will ever be one like it again. I love when Pinhead goes \"Oh Kirsty, I have such sights to show you\". Barker took gore to another level because I was definitely creeped out by Frank walking around with no skin on his very bloody, and very fleshy skeleton. There definitely aren't too many scary and orginal horror movies today but, \"Hellraiser\" is one of a kind.";
	public static final String NEGATIVE = "I expected this to be the funniest film ever made. Well, it's not. However, it is original and Sacha Baron Cohen put forth a tour de force performance in \"Borat\". In my opinion the funniest parts of the film are those in which Cohen as Borat, interacts with people who have no idea who he is. His attempts to give men welcome kisses as he walks the streets of NY are hysterical. The driving lesson is outrageously funny as a real driving instructor, oblivious to the fact that Cohen is acting, tries to cope with Borat's attempts to drink booze while shouting obscenities at other drivers. You will fall down laughing. Another great segment is the ride in the RV with the sexist college frat boys. Cutting edge stuff. However, a lot of the other material falls flat. The rodeo is embarrassing. The nude wrestling scene could have used a good edit. Pamela Anderson obviously knew who Cohen was when he appeared at her \"book signing\" and it's just not spontaneous. Also -- what happened to the song, \"Throw the J**s down the well so my country can be free?\" I heard it prior to the film's release; it really made you think about the convenience anti-semitism provides to some folks and, at the same time, was terribly funny. Much better than the National Anthem sequence at the rodeo. Gone in the R-rated version. Also, warning - the scatological humor in \"Borat\" is just revolting. See the film -- Cohen is amazing. But I'm wondering where he can go from here. I hope his next film has a better editor and is a bit better crafted. too bad 28 Weeks Later didn't follow suit. 28 Weeks Later is a good Horror movie, but a bad sequel. 28 Weeks (fledgling) director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo dropped the ball on several fronts...most importantly that the Rage Virus was supposed to be extremely contagious...coming into contact with just one drop of the contagion should render anyone 'infected'; part of 28 Weeks is the introduction of potentially immune people (just like in The Stand), and that was not lost on me. But there is 'infected' spatter everywhere and on everyone in this movie that seems to have no effect, and that takes away a lot of the realism and continuity that held true in 28 Days. 28 Weeks also fails in the way it delivers its scares. In Weeks there's lot's of scare moments that unnecessarily rely more on focusing on an image where one second their is nothing there and it's a deadly silent, then the next second there's a frightening image crashing into the shot accompanied by a loud \"PUNG!!!\" (like someone landing on the low keys of a piano). Granted, in DTS 5.1, it effectively knocked me of my chair each time, but it was quite dissimilar to 28 Days where the situations and images alone were enough to knock me out of my chair without the 'BOO!' effect. 28 Weeks also breaks down in the reality department where tight, military-secure areas are breached by civilians (including teenagers) and a Rage-infected person is not only able to breach dozens of secure areas, but also manages to appear everywhere in the movie. It's the small (important) things like these that took a great movie in 28 Days and turned out an average sequel in 28 Weeks. So overall, Boyle's 5-star Horror/Drama goes to a 3-star Fresnadillo follow-up for me. Final words: Buy 28 Days Later for your collection; rent 28 Weeks Later.";

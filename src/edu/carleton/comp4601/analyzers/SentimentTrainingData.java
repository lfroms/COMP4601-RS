	public static final String POSITIVE = "This DVD has everything if you love Jaws! The extra footage is massive! All of the inner workings - or malfunctions - of the shark are presented here. The movie itself is classic. I remember being so scared of the water after seeing this movie. The acting/directing here is superb, and the shark itself is terrifying. Now, I know there are those that will say that the shark looks too fake or that it doesn't show up enough. However, have you ever seen \"Deep Blue Sea?\" Jaws is everything that \"sea\" isn't. The absence of the shark actually builds the suspense in the movie. This movie is incredible and the extra features make this an incredible DVD purchase! \"Jaws\" is a tremendously entertaining action/adventure film. It's not really a horror film although it contains horror elements. Director Spielberg draws superlative performances from his main characters and it's their interplay which is particularly memorable. Brilliantly directed and conceived by Spielberg and featuring the iconic John Willams theme - this is a film classic. Don't bother with any of the sequels. The movie has everything one in this genre should have, suspense, action, mystery, thrills, betrayal, love and even humor! I will probably watch this movie again soon because I know I will enjoy it a second time. If you have not seen it yet, I recommend you do it as soon as possible. Simply put, this film can't earn less than 5 stars; it's a seamless piece of work that should really have run off with more awards than it got. The performances are universally excellent--and maybe the casting director has to take the credit, maybe not--so it's hard to pick a singular stand-out lead in the whole piece. And Kevin Spacey is generally so good, we kind of take it for granted here. Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce as virtual unknowns in a Hollywood picture convince you very early on that they belong in the film. Shot on location in Hollywood, with all the appropriate setpieces, hairstyles, mannerisms, this is a film that (minus the profanity and nudity) could have been released 40 years ago to similar acclaim. It won a well-deserved Academy award for its screenplay, but from top to bottom, this film is a perennial and should find its way into every DVD player until the end of time. This movie is one of the best movies ever made, and definitely one of my favorites. This movies takes you down to the boundaries of \"Hell\". Clive Barker has most certainly made history with \"Hellraiser\", and I don't think there will ever be one like it again. I love when Pinhead goes \"Oh Kirsty, I have such sights to show you\". Barker took gore to another level because I was definitely creeped out by Frank walking around with no skin on his very bloody, and very fleshy skeleton. There definitely aren't too many scary and orginal horror movies today but, \"Hellraiser\" is one of a kind. \"Goodfellas\" was recently named in a British magazine as \"The Greatest Film Of All Time\". While that is up for debate, there is no doubt that it's up there. Brutal, shocking and true, \"Goodfellas\" is cinema at best. This film is truly a masterpiece. It's by far Scorcese's best film, and the actors have rarely been better. Pesci deserved his Oscar, because he stole the show from everyone. This is a film that everyone should see at least once. STARSHIP TROOPERS is both brilliant satire AND highly entertaining, well crafted sci-fi adventure flick. The concept behind it and what you get on the screen is a perfect parody of infamous WWII propaganda films. TROOPERS lightheartedly calls the viewer's attention to the propensity of propagandized, jingoistic humans for senseless violence without conscience, comicly using a war of humans versus mindless, souless, agressive \"bugs\" to make the point. In the top 20 best sci-fi films ever and a lot of fun. This is an awesome film full of dazzling (and grotesque) visual effects and great and funny characters! A don't-miss extravaganza! Gung-ho! Grade: A+ John (Owen Wilson) & Jeremy (Vince Vaughn) are best buds. They've known each other for 17 years, work together, and in there spare time crash wedding parties; where they drink like sailors, mingle with unsuspecting relatives, and hit on single and willing brides maids every chance they get. They have a whole science to their crashing ( rules and all), and have become quite adept at the sport. That all changes when they attend a wedding held by Secretary Cleary (Christopher Walken), whose daughter is getting hitched. During the lavish formal affair, Jeremy makes headway with Cleary's physcopath daughter Gloria ( a hilarious Isla Fisher), while John slowly maneuvers his way into the life of the Secretary's other daughter Claire (Rachel McAdams), who just happens to have a steady bo' of her own. Eventually, after all the formalities-- the two are privately invited back to the Secretary's estate, where they play touch football with the family, have formal dinners, sail out on the boat, & get hit on by the Secretary's sex starved wife (Jane Seymour) & his homosexual son Todd (Keir O'Donnell). Its all very funny and silly- but the great chemistry by Wilson and Vaughn helps the film move at a steady pace. The supporting roles of McAdams and Fishler are nicely fleshed out as well. While no means a great movie, \"The Wedding Crashers\" is quite funny at times, and overall enjoyable. Some people have called this a raunchy, gross-out comedy; although I noticed nothing of the sort. Besides the dialogue and a few breast shots, theres really nothing raunchy or gross-out about \"Wedding Crashers\" at all. It certainly wouldnt fall into the category of \"Something About Mary\" or the \"American Pie\" movies. Vaughn and Wilson definitley shine throughout and appear to be having the time of their lives here.... Recommended. Hollywood in the 1940s: The LAPD is primed to forge a prestigious, competent public image when the incarceration of crime kingpin Mickey Cohen provides the opportunity to rid LA of organized crime. Three officers symbolize the directions the department might take: Bud White (Russell Crowe), violent and flexible with his ethics; Ed Exley (Guy Pierce), a by-the-book opportunist; and Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), plugged into the show business scene and eager to remain so. A massacre at a coffee shop starts a series of events that will offer each of these morally conflicted men a measure of redemption. This film boasts a huge cast of characters and a complex storyline but never confuses. Director/co-screenwriter Curtis Hansen deserves high praise, as does his marvelous cast. This film has tremendous atmosphere and feels absolutely authentic. Highly recommended.";
	public static final String NEGATIVE = "I expected this to be the funniest film ever made. Well, it's not. However, it is original and Sacha Baron Cohen put forth a tour de force performance in \"Borat\". In my opinion the funniest parts of the film are those in which Cohen as Borat, interacts with people who have no idea who he is. His attempts to give men welcome kisses as he walks the streets of NY are hysterical. The driving lesson is outrageously funny as a real driving instructor, oblivious to the fact that Cohen is acting, tries to cope with Borat's attempts to drink booze while shouting obscenities at other drivers. You will fall down laughing. Another great segment is the ride in the RV with the sexist college frat boys. Cutting edge stuff. However, a lot of the other material falls flat. The rodeo is embarrassing. The nude wrestling scene could have used a good edit. Pamela Anderson obviously knew who Cohen was when he appeared at her \"book signing\" and it's just not spontaneous. Also -- what happened to the song, \"Throw the J**s down the well so my country can be free?\" I heard it prior to the film's release; it really made you think about the convenience anti-semitism provides to some folks and, at the same time, was terribly funny. Much better than the National Anthem sequence at the rodeo. Gone in the R-rated version. Also, warning - the scatological humor in \"Borat\" is just revolting. See the film -- Cohen is amazing. But I'm wondering where he can go from here. I hope his next film has a better editor and is a bit better crafted. \"Hostage\" for all of its action is really a pretty boring picture. Once the movie started to focus more on the action and less on the characters I found myself tunning out every now and then. The movie started off as a character study of Talley and then just abandons everything for action. Why? They were starting off so well. But what are we going to do. Here is a perfect example of why Hollywood has been losing money lately as attendance is a recent lows. People simply aren't going out to see movies anymore because we don't wnat to see movies like \"Hostage\". Why should I pay 10 dollars to goes see junk like this when I can rent it for half the price or even wait for it to play on TV? This is why of weeks Hollywood is losing out. They don't realize we are sick of their movies. But go ahead Hollywood keep making these movies and losing money. It merely shows how out of touch you are with the public. * 1\\2 out of ***** Wait! So we are supposed to believe that the shark went after the family for revenge? That is the worst plot ever, The acting in Jaws 3 was horrible but this is somehow even worse, Lorraine Gary tries to go all Ripley and fails miserably, The shark looked ok in places, But it felt more of a spoof than a sequel, It's not scary it's not fun and the ending was poorly done, Easily the worst if the Jaws films and could be a contender for worst film ever, This is a disappointment from movies and the Jaws franchise. \"Jaws: The Revenge\" is a terrible movie and definitely the worst \"Jaws\" sequel. The acting in this movie is bad, the only good actor is \"Michael Caine\". The plot to \"Jaws: The Revenge\" is that a shark wants to get revenge on the \"Brody\" family for all the other sharks that were killed. The plot is the worst plot to a movie I have ever seen. \"Jaws: The Revenge\" has terrible horror shots of people being murdered by the shark. The music in this movie is terrible, there is no music in the film that fits in with any of the scenes. Finally this movie is no boring there are no entertaining scenes at all. I highly recommend you DO NOT watch \"Jaws: The Revenge\" as it is a horrible film. So I give \"Jaws: The Revenge\" a 0.5/10. Awful, uninspired comedy about a brat, this is one of the worst comedies I had the misfortune of seeing. Poorly written, acted and directed, this is a film that never was funny to begin with. I never understood why this film was a hit, as it is painful to watch. I found the film to be very unfunny, and the lead child actor was really annoying and unfunny. The film tries too hat delivering effective gags, and it fails because the material just doesn't cut it. In terms of a good comedy, this film doesn't even come close as being a funny film. The cast make it a horrible film, and the directing is unfocused and sloppy, that's to be expected from a Dennis Dugan film. This is comedy at its lowest form. A tiresome, boring film that is just painful to watch, Problem Child is a misfire of a film, one that never should have been made in the first place. The script has its limitations, and it constantly shows on-screen. If you're looking for a funny film with this one, you'll be sadly disappointed. I despised everything about this film, and I thought it was bad from start to finish. The film didn't even have potential of being a good comedy. This is one of those films that just has nothing good going for it. You should definitely avoid it, and watch a funnier film than this. This one scraps the bottom of the barrel, and it's too flawed to work. Avoid it like the plague. Annoying and never funny, this has got to be one of the worst films in the genre. I think it's a shame that celluloid was wasted on trash like this. Awful as a kid, awful as a adult. The kids are annoying and the adults in the movie are kind of dumb and gullible in nature. I imagine that these movies are played on repeat in Hell lol. An unfunny and mean-spirited comedy franchise. One of the worst comedies I have watched. It sounds funny and a lot of people like films like this such as Dennis The Menace. But this is a poor excuse for a comedy. The script is poor,the acting is poor and everything else about this film is terrible and cheap. It doesn't deserve to be called a comedy, because it is not. I have seen another comedy that I thought was awful and so did a lot of people. Even this poorly done film isn't worse than that. Why a sequel was made I have no idea. Do not waste your money buying this film. It is a complete disaster. This one is really scraping the bottom of the barrel. The only thing that can be said is that it's slightly better than the sequel. Problem Child is horribly acted, has lame jokes, and features one of the worst child actors in history. 1/5 stars an awful comedy";

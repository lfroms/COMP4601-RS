	public static final String POSITIVE = "everything love classic superb incredible the extra features incredible tremendously entertaining action/adventure film superlative performances interplay particularly memorable. Brilliantly directed conceived Spielberg and featuring the iconic theme - this is a film classic. The movie has everything one in this genre should have, suspense, action, mystery, thrills, betrayal, love and even humor! I will probably watch this movie again soon because I know I will enjoy it a second time. I recommend Simply put, this film can't earn less than 5 stars; it's a seamless piece of work that should really have run off with more awards than it got. The performances are universally excellent generally so good, could have been released 40 years ago to similar acclaim. It won a well-deserved Academy award for its screenplay, but from top to bottom, this film is a and should find its way into every DVD player until the end of time. This movie is one of the best movies ever made, and definitely one of my favorites. most certainly made history is one of a kind. was recently named in a British magazine as \"The Greatest Film Of All Time\". is cinema at best. This film is truly a masterpiece. It's by far Scorcese's best film, and the actors have rarely been better. deserved his Oscar, because he stole the show from everyone. This is a film that everyone should see at least once. is both brilliant satire AND highly entertaining, well crafted sci-fi adventure flick. The concept behind it and what you get on the screen is a perfect parody of infamous WWII propaganda films. lightheartedly calls the viewer's attention to the propensity of propagandized, jingoistic humans for senseless without conscience, using a war of humans versus mindless,, \"bugs\" to make the point. In the top 20 best sci-fi films ever and a lot of fun. This is an awesome film full of dazzling (and grotesque) visual effects and great and funny characters! A don't-miss extravaganza! Gung-ho! Grade: A+ are best buds. They've known each other for years, work together, and in there spare time crash wedding parties; where they drink like sailors, mingle with unsuspecting relatives, and hit on single and willing brides maids every chance they get. They have a whole science to their crashing ( rules and all), and have become quite adept at the sport. That all changes when they attend a wedding held by, whose daughter is getting hitched. During the lavish formal affair, makes headway with physcopath daughter a hilarious , while slowly maneuvers his way into the life of the Secretary's other daughter, who just happens to have a steady bo' of her own. Eventually, after all the formalities-- the two are privately invited back to the Secretary's estate, where they play touch football with the family, have formal dinners, sail out on the boat, & get hit on by the Secretary's sex starved wife & his homosexual son Its all very funny and silly- but the great chemistry by and helps the film move at a steady pace. The supporting roles of and are nicely fleshed out as well. While no means a great movie, \"The Wedding Crashers\" is quite funny at times, and overall enjoyable. Some people have called this a raunchy, gross-out comedy; although I noticed nothing of the sort. Besides the dialogue and a few breast shots, theres really nothing raunchy or gross-out about \"Wedding Crashers\" at all. It certainly wouldnt fall into the category of \"Something About Mary\" or the \"American Pie\" movies. definitely shine throughout and appear to be having the time of their lives here.... Recommended. Hollywood in the 1940s: The is primed to forge a prestigious, competent public image when the incarceration of crime kingpin provides the opportunity to rid LA of organized crime. Three officers symbolize the directions the department might take: Bud White, and flexible with his ethics;, a by-the-book opportunist; and plugged into the show business scene and eager to remain so. A massacre at a coffee shop starts a series of events that will offer each of these morally conflicted men a measure of redemption. This film boasts a huge cast of characters and a complex storyline but never confuses. deserves high praise, as does his marvelous cast. This film has a tremendous atmosphere and feels absolutely authentic. Highly recommended. The cinematography in this movie is the best I have ever seen. It is a turn of the century love story They were childhood sweethearts, unwillingly seperated as youngsters, but cross paths years later, at one of shows. She is already engaged to a crowned prince, but still loves Norton's character. They decide they want to be together again, and this is where the movie takes off. The story itself is WONDERFUL, but even more than that, The reason I wrote this review was just to comment on the QUALITY of this picture. The sets are so wonderful, it will have you totally believing that you fell through a hole in time. The picture quality is so out of this world that the regular DVD looks like it is in high definition...Not only is the quality sharp, the entire movie has a beautiful golden hue, and I swear it looks like you are in an oil painting. I have seen good cinematography on movies like but this is the best I've seen. The casting too, couldn't have been done any better. Take all that, add a great storyline, and you have a MASTERPIECE !!! There hasn't been a movie ever since that has really made me watch with full attention not knowing what to expect in the next scene. is a genius form of storytelling. The movie is simply a love story but with an original plot and excellent performances by the two lead stars, is an instant classic. is quite surprising in his dramatic, but funny, turn. A turn that will most definitely earn him Hollywood praise (and a golden statue!) in the future., who was nominated for Best Actress for her work here, is incredibly convincing and proves to be perfect competition for is by far one of the best movies of the past ten years. Highly recommended A+";
	public static final String NEGATIVE = "I expected this to be the funniest film ever made. Well, it's not. However, it is original and put forth a tour de force performance in. In my opinion the funniest parts of the film are those in which as, interacts with people who have no idea who he is. His attempts to give men welcome kisses as he walks the streets of NY are hysterical. The driving lesson is outrageously funny as a real driving instructor, oblivious to the fact that is acting, tries to cope with attempts to drink booze while shouting obscenities at other drivers. You will fall down laughing. Another great segment is the ride in the RV with the sexist college frat boys. Cutting edge stuff. However, a lot of the other material falls flat. The rodeo is embarrassing. The nude wrestling scene could have used a good edit. Pamela Anderson obviously knew who was when he appeared at her \"book signing\" and it's just not spontaneous. Also what happened to the song, \"Throw the J**s down the well so my country can be free?\" I heard it prior to the film's release; it really made you think about the convenience anti-semitism provides to some folks and, at the same time, was terribly funny. Much better than the sequence at the rodeo. Gone in the R-rated version. Also, warning the scatological humor in is just revolting. But I'm wondering where he can go from here. I hope his next film has a better editor and is a bit better crafted. Hostage for all of its action is really a pretty boring picture. Once the movie started to focus more on the action and less on the characters I found myself tunning out every now and then. The movie started off as a character study of Talley and then just abandons everything for action. Why? They were starting off so well. But what are we going to do. Here is a perfect example of why Hollywood has been losing money lately as attendance is a recent lows. People simply aren't going out to see movies anymore because we don't wnat to see movies like \"Hostage\". Why should I pay 10 dollars to goes see junk like this when I can rent it for half the price or even wait for it to play on TV? This is why of weeks Hollywood is losing out. They don't realize we are sick of their movies. But go ahead Hollywood keep making these movies and losing money. It merely shows how out of touch you are with the public. * 1\\2 out of ***** Wait! So we are supposed to believe that the shark went after the family for revenge? That is the worst plot ever, The acting in 3 was horrible but this is somehow even worse, tries to go all and fails miserably, The shark looked ok in places, But it felt more of a spoof than a sequel, It's not scary it's not fun and the ending was poorly done, Easily the worst if the films and could be a contender for worst film ever, This is a disappointment from movies and the franchise. The Revenge is a terrible movie and definitely the worst sequel. The acting in this movie is bad, the only good actor is The plot to The Revenge is that a shark wants to get revenge on the family for all the other sharks that were killed. The plot is the worst plot to a movie I have ever seen. The Revenge has terrible horror shots of people being murdered by the shark. The music in this movie is terrible, there is no music in the film that fits in with any of the scenes. Finally this movie is no boring there are no entertaining scenes at all. I highly recommend you DO NOT watch The Revenge as it is a horrible film. So I give The Revenge a 0.5/10. Awful, uninspired comedy about a brat, this is one of the worst comedies I had the misfortune of seeing. Poorly written, acted and directed, this is a film that never was funny to begin with. I never understood why this film was a hit, as it is painful to watch. I found the film to be very unfunny, and the lead child actor was really annoying and unfunny. The film tries too hard delivering effective gags, and it fails because the material just doesn't cut it. In terms of a good comedy, this film doesn't even come close as being a funny film. The cast make it a horrible film, and the directing is unfocused and sloppy, that's to be expected from a film. This is comedy at its lowest form. A tiresome, boring film that is just painful to watch, Problem Child is a misfire of a film, one that never should have been made in the first place. The script has its limitations, and it constantly shows on-screen. If you're looking for a funny film with this one, you'll be sadly disappointed. I despised everything about this film, and I thought it was bad from start to finish. The film didn't even have potential of being a good comedy. This is one of those films that just has nothing good going for it. You should definitely avoid it, and watch a funnier film than this. This one scraps the bottom of the barrel, and it's too flawed to work. Avoid it like the plague. Annoying and never funny, this has got to be one of the worst films in the genre. I think it's a shame that celluloid was wasted on trash like this. Awful as a kid, awful as an adult. The kids are annoying and the adults in the movie are kind of dumb and gullible in nature. I imagine that these movies are played on repeat in Hell lol. An unfunny and mean-spirited comedy franchise. One of the worst comedies I have watched. It sounds funny and a lot of people like films But this is a poor excuse for a comedy. The script is poor,the acting is poor and everything else about this film is terrible and cheap. It doesn't deserve to be called a comedy, because it is not. I have seen another comedy that I thought was awful and so did a lot of people. Even this poorly done film isn't worse than that. Why a sequel was made I have no idea. Do not waste your money buying this film. It is a complete disaster. This one is really scraping the bottom of the barrel. The only thing that can be said is that it's slightly better than the sequel. Problem Child is horribly acted, has lame jokes, and features one of the worst child actors in history. 1/5 stars an awful comedy";
